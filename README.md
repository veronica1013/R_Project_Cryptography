## Cryptography Online Marketing

## Overview
According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography), until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to encryption, which is the process of converting ordinary information (called plaintext) into unintelligible form (called ciphertext). Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext.
